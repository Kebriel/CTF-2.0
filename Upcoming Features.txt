### A list of planned features
- Allow Bandage to work on teammates, and double its
strength if it's used this way
- Add the 'Reinforce' perk
    - Grants a redstone torch in-game. When clicked,
    brings up a menu of all teammates. Choosing a
    teammate teleports you instantly to them, causing a dramatic
    lightning strike
    - Reinforcing grants you speed, and grants the player you
    reinforced regen, strength and resistance
    - Has a very long cooldown (at least 5 minutes)
    - You cannot reinforce players who are at or above 60% health
    - If you have stealth equipped, there is no lightning strike
    when you reinforce a player.
    - If the player being reinforced has stealth equipped but you don't, they
    will also gain true invisibility for 6s. Additionally, subtext
    in the reinforcement menu will note if the target has stealth
    equipped and warn you that said player might not take kindly to
    a noisy reinforcement. There will also be a confirmation box in
    the event that you click such a player. If the player is carrying
    a flag, they will still be invisible but the flag will not, and
    will be seen hovering wherever they are
- Add the 'Engineer' perk
    - Allows you to spend a small amount of gold to build a turret
    at a location
    - Turrets are immobile, but can rotate to aim at the nearest valid
    target
    - Only one turret per player can exist at a time. If a player builds
    a turret while another of theirs already exists, the old one will
    instantly disappear
    - A turret has a set lifespan, which increases marginally based on the
    level of its creator (cap of 8 min). Turrets also have a healthbar,
    they can be hit by enemies once per second a total of ten times before
    being destroyed. They do not regenerate health.
    - The Firebrand sword is efficient at killing turrets, it does so at twice the speed of regular
    swords. Turrets are immune to all projectiles except arrows, which deal
    half damage. Arrows benefiting from Point Blank or Long Shot deal as much
    damage as a sword hit.
    - Turrets fire arrows at a rate of once per second at the nearest enemy that they
    have a clear shot at. They are willing and able to shoot through non-solid blocks
    like vines, grass and falling water. Turret arrows do the same damage as regular arrows,
    and benefit from the Point Blank perk if their owner has it equipped (they must keep it
    equipped the whole time, not just when they create the turret).
    - Abilities that give resistance to arrows are more effective against turret arrows than their
    regular counterparts.
    - Turrets will target enemy turrets, but they will prioritize enemy players first. If a turret
    has targeted another turret but an enemy player walks within range, the turret will pivot
    to the player immediately.
    - Too many turrets cannot be coalesced in the same place. An allied turret cannot be
    placed within 8 blocks of another allied turret. This is to prevent multiple
    players with this perk stacking a bunch of turrets around their team's flag
    - Turrets have an effective range of 7 blocks, but will begin aiming at targets who are
    within 8 blocks.
    - Turrets have 100% accuracy against stationary targets, but will have to adjust aim for
    moving targets and will have their accuracy vary based on the target's moving patterns. A.k.a,
    strafing is an effective method of dodging turret arrows (though not 100% effective, they
    can still hit strafing players).
- Add remaining cosmetic types
    - Arrow trails
    - Special kill messages (unique reformatting of the global
    message that plays when you get a kill)
    - Kill effect (visual effect that plays when you
    kill a player)
